# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Please clone the repo, `npm install` and then `npm start`.

## Some Remarks

- Hopefully I understood the challenge well and didn't miss anything - I'm not a blockchain expert (yet).
- Like asked, this is focused on functionality and code, so the design and the CSS is not optimal.
- The code itself could also, of course, be optimised, given a larger application (shared Form, Button and Details component, for example), but given the small scale app and the time asked to spend on it, I think that should do (I hope I'm not wrong!!!).
- Feel free to ask me questions about the code.

## Enjoy!
